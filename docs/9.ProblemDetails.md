# `ProblemDetails`

Failed operations are handled by the `MatchErrorResult` class. This class will generate a response with the error messages.

Messages can be formatted into JSON as a list of `ResultMessage` or transformed into a `ProblemDetails` object.

The return format is configurable. You can define the return pattern (`ResultMessage` or `ProblemDetails`),
or the client can request the format via the `X-ErrorType` header.
